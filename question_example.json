    "question": "Suppose we modify the Diffie-Hellman protocol. Alice chooses a random $a \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ and sends $A = g^a \\pmod{p}$ to Bob. Bob, however, chooses a random $b \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ and sends $B = g^{1/b} \\pmod{p}$ to Alice (where $1/b$ denotes $b^{-1} \\pmod{p-1}$, the modular multiplicative inverse of $b$ modulo $p-1$). What shared secret can they generate and how would they do it?",
